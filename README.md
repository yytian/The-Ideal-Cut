The-Ideal-Cut
=============

High school economics project. Programming by Jim Tian. Made as a group with Nida Noorani, Alice Wang, and Neville Chan.

There is no documentation for building the application yet, but one can run the game by downloading executable.jar (requires JRE version >= 7). One must first download the jcommon and jfreechart jars into the same directory as executable.jar.
