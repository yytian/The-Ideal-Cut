Four firms, led by the cleverest and most ruthless men in the industry, have managed to corner the diamond market; they are the only ones which are capable of production. The future looks bright.
Then the CEOs died, and were for some reason replaced with first-year economics students.

In this game, each player controls a company; the four companies are materially equal in every way. Through the management of prices and production levels, as well as non-market factors such as advertisement, each company seeks to better its position and earn a greater profit. The game ends after a certain number of turns (other win conditions may or may not be added); at the end of the game, the companies with the best bottom line has its score added to the high-scores lists.

It is immediately obvious that there are two opposing interests at work for each company. The first is that to get onto the score-board, long-term profit must be as high as possible; this is best achieved through the four firms cooperating as an oligopoly. The other is that only one company can actually win the game, and to do so must at some point work for the short-term benefit of the firm rather than the long-term benefit of the industry. Essentially, the firms must cooperate so that the overall prosperity of the industry is high enough for a high score, but must also compete to become the one firm which gets to have its score added. Any wouldbe victor must balance these two interests and manipulate the other companies' actions successfully.

Before each turn, the companies will gather to discuss diplomatically the best course of action. Each company will submit its actions without knowledge of the other companies' actions. It is the goal of the simulation that, without prior knowledge of the theory of oligopolies and cartels, the market structure will lead the players to emulate the historical cycle of the formation, prosperity, and downfall of cartels.
