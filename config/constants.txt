/* DEMAND
The function is y = ax + b, where y is the quantity, a is the slope, x is the price and b is the y-intercept
Going with linear function for now since I was tired of fiddling with quadratics, can always change it later */

slope		-0.025
y-intercept	77.5

/* SUPPLY
The function is y = ax^3 - bx^2 + cx + d, where y is the cost of production and x is the quantity. The rest are constants.
In case you're wondering I looked it up and apparently this is how they usually simulate it
Results in quadratic increasing efficiency at the beginning, cubic decreasing efficiency later */

b	0
c	150.0
